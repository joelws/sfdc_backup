# Salesforce Backup Script 
- Script to run on a schedule to backup your SFDC instance to a SQL Lite DB 

## SFDC Auth & DB Password Protection 
- When the script initial runs it will prompt you to enter your Salesforce Credentials and Key into the CLI 
    - This will encrypt them and save the credentials for futrue runs. I'd run this once in your regular CLI before scheduling.
